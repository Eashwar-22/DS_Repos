##  tools_ (go to branch - eda)
Module(s) to be used as package .

```sh
import tools_ 
```

### Details:
- Performing typical EDA methods and organizing the features before modelling.
- Reducing manual validation of features categorization to an extent. It is an empirical process based on using different datasets.
- The class methods are to be used as libraries hence the script is meant to be a package. _Has not properly been converted yet. Subject to change._

### Observations (updating)
- Currently WIP, output format could be better. The goal is to keep it more structural.
- Can use inputs from existing eda tools such as pandas-profiling, dtale, etc.
